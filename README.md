## Summary

In this module we learnt basics of SQL, right from creating an Entity Relationship diagram (ERD), converting this to a logical schema before actually creating the tables in the database. 

Learnt about different types of datatypes, primary and foreign key constraints and how to retreive data from 2 tables using joins. We also learnt copying the summary data from a join query into a brand new table.
